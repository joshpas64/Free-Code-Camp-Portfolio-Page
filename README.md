This was the second project in the first part of learning front-end webdev at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a> 

The description of the project was to build a portfolio page for yourself following <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage">these rules.</a> 
And following this <a href="https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/">example.</a>

This repository will include the <strong>FULL SOURCE CODE</strong>, which include some of the html and frameworks included in a codepen project as well as the code you put in the tabs you create a new codepen.io <strong>pen</strong>.

Usually a codepen has 3 tabs          
                                 
The <strong>HTML</strong> tab is where you right and edit all the html code that will provide the content and basic framework, layout, and organization to your webpage. <em> ALSO </em> note, that all the code written in the <strong>CSS tab</strong> and <strong>JS tab</strong> are all automically linked to the html page that is in your pen.
